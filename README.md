This repository contains a conceptual and architectural framework exploring the need for internal ethical counterweights in AI-assisted decision-making systems.

This document is not intended as an academic paper or a regulatory proposal.
It is a foundational design-space exploration aimed at identifying structural risks emerging from amplified human decision power mediated by AI systems.

The purpose of this repository is to establish prior conceptual work and enable future dialogue.
